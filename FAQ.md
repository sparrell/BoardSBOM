This doc is just a conversation starter. It assumes the ‘format’ we want is adding to FAQ. Same content, obviously organized differently, could go in 2-pager or in ‘letter to the board’ formats.

Editorial comment:
Do we prefer one question with multiple conditional answers or multiple questions for each conditional? Currently drafted

See [Workplan](./WorkPlan.md) for the structure of the work proposed
and how the FAQ fit into that structure.

# Corporate Boards
Editorial Aside - it is proposed t
his is a new section in the FAQ,
and it has some text 'after header',
has subsections of its own.

Corporate Boards are responsible for oversight, strategy, and risk. The following questions are questions Board members should be asking if they are relevant to their business.
A board member should be able to read through these FAQs and then be able to ask appropriate questions wrt their corporate SBOM strategy.

This Board section is divided into 4 sections which could be viewed
as a pryramid with more FAQs and more details at the lower layers.

## FAQ for all Board Members
### As a Board Member, do I need to know about SBOMs?

No. However,
all Board Members should feel comfortable 
that the appropriate Board roles and 
Executive Team members
know the corporate SBOM strategy,
the strategic opportunties it offers (if any),
and the existential risks (if any) that it mitigates.
The opportunities and risks differ for 
public/private, 
profit/non-profile,
your industry,
and your company specifics.
See the FAQs in the following subsections for more detail.

### Why should Boards care about SBOM strategy now?
"Software is eating the world."
Digital transformation and the rise in cyber crime
have changed the landscape.
What were reasonable assumptions about how software
affects your buiness are no longer true and need to be revisited.
Your SBOM strategy may or may not rate Board level discussion,
but it is much more likely now and likely to be more so in the future.
See the previous FAQ and 
the FAQs in the following subsections for more detail.

## More detailed FAQ 

(better title needed)

### How will our company’s SBOM strategy increase or decrease our revenue?

A1: produce and supply USG

A2: consume and supply USG

A3: profit vs nonprofit

should this be a 'opportunity' FAQ that leads to diff Q for profit and nonprofit?

### How will our company’s SBOM strategy increase or decrease our expenses?

### How do SBOMs relate to SEC rules?
If you are a publicly traded company (so SEC rules apply), there are no (at the time of this writing) direct mention of SBOMs in the SEC rules. However, there are some 2nd-order effects of the company’s SBOM policies that Board members should be aware of. 

SEC Regulation S-K Item 106 does require the Board of Directors to describe their processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, as well as the material effects or reasonably likely material effects of risks from cybersecurity threats and previous cybersecurity incidents. It is reasonable that those processes should include the company’s SBOM policies with respect to how the company manages cybersecurity risk associated with the software it produces, the software it obtains from suppliers, and the software it uses.

SEC Item 1.05 of Form 8-K is required to describe any cybersecurity incident with material impact, and to describe the incident’s nature, scope, and timing. A well planned and implemented SBOM policy will, when combined with a well planned and and implemented vulnerability management program, both reduce the likelihood of a material incident, and speed the response for certain incidents. Note the company is also a supplier (either directly or indirectly) to the US Gov, then the company’s incident response processes should include the relevant SBOM policies as required in the FAR.

### How do SBOMs relate to FARs?
If the company supplies to the US Gov, either directly or indirectly, then the FARs requirments on SBOMs apply. See Q&A on revenue.
