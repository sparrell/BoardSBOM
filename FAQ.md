This doc is just a conversation starter. It assumes the ‘format’ we want is adding to FAQ. Same content, obviously organized differently, could go in 2-pager or in ‘letter to the board’ formats.

Editorial comment:
Do we prefer one question with multiple conditional answers or multiple questions for each conditional? Currently drafted

Leadin in section of FAQ on Boards:

Q: How will our company’s SBOM strategy increase or decrease our revenue?

A1: produce and supply USG

A2: consume and supply USG

A3: profit vs nonprofit

Q: How will our company’s SBOM strategy increase or decrease our expenses?

Q: How do SBOMs relate to SEC rules?
A: If you are a publicly traded company (so SEC rules apply), there are no (at the time of this writing) direct mention of SBOMs in the SEC rules. However, there are some 2nd-order effects of the company’s SBOM policies that Board members should be aware of. 

SEC Regulation S-K Item 106 does require the Board of Directors to describe their processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, as well as the material effects or reasonably likely material effects of risks from cybersecurity threats and previous cybersecurity incidents. It is reasonable that those processes should include the company’s SBOM policies with respect to how the company manages cybersecurity risk associated with the software it produces, the software it obtains from suppliers, and the software it uses.

SEC Item 1.05 of Form 8-K is required to describe any cybersecurity incident with material impact, and to describe the incident’s nature, scope, and timing. A well planned and implemented SBOM policy will, when combined with a well planned and and implemented vulnerability management program, both reduce the likelihood of a material incident, and speed the response for certain incidents. Note the company is also a supplier (either directly or indirectly) to the US Gov, then the company’s incident response processes should include the relevant SBOM policies as required in the FAR.

Q: How do SBOMs relate to FARs?
If the company supplies to the US Gov, either directly or indirectly, then the FARs requirments on SBOMs apply. See Q&A on revenue.

Q: Why should a company’s Board care about SBOMs?
A: See {add bunch of links to other q’s) or say see previous X questions
