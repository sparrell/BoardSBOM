## Workplan / Artifact list
Once work is complete, there will be several arifacts,
each with a different audience/purpose in mind.
The package could be seen as pyramid, 
with each level of the pyramid linking up or down as appropriate
to whether a top-down or bottom-up communication strategy is used.
Consensus is top-down is preferred - ie Board Members 
are more receptive if they think it's their idea and are asking
probing questions vs passively listening to and approving Executive plans.
However it also serves as template for bottom-up so Management is ready
for Board questions - potentially even before they ask them.

The top of the pyramid would be 
[two FAQ](./FAQ.md#faq-for-all-board-members),
directed at Board Members "from the outside".
The audience for these is any member of any board
independent of whether the board is profit/non-profit,
public/private, any industry, and whether the 
board member has any cyber or risk or audit responsibilities.
The questions basically boil down to 
"[should I care](./FAQ.md#as-a-board-member-do-i-need-to-know-about-sboms)
and "[why now?](./FAQ.md#why-should-boards-care-about-sbom-strategy-now)".

The second level of the pyramid would also be 
[FAQs](./FAQ.md#more-detailed-faq),
some directed at any board members,
some directed at board members with particular roles.
These could be prompted by the top 2 FAQs, 
but also serve as linkage 
to the meat 
in the two-pagers and presentations.

The third level of the pyramid would be 
["two pagers"](./FAQ.md#for-more-information).
There may be "one 2-pager to rule them all" 
but there wll may also be
role-specfic (eg Board Audit Committee Member, Board Cyber Oversight Member, CEO, COO. ...),
profile-specific (eg public/private, profit/non-profit, large/small, ...),
and industry-specific two-pagers.
There would be FAQs linking to each 2-pager, 
and placeholder-FAQs might help the work plan see the 'structure' and status.

The bottom layer of the pyramid would be template 
[presentations to the board](./FAQ.md#board-presentations),
that the Executive Team and their supporting organizations would use
to brief the board either in response to "outside in" questions the board
wants answers to, or from a 'inside up' strategy 
associated with Board buy-in to proposed corporate SBOM strategy
